# Crypto Sentiment
# Fintech Homework for Named Entity Recognition 

In this exercise we investigate the sentiment of Bitcion and Ethereum based on relevant articles downloaded using the News API.  

The Python tools and libraries used include Vader, NLP, Displacy (Spacy package).  These packages enable us to process unstructured text and derive sentiment, tokens, and most importantly, named entities.  Named entities assigned labels to each relevant word in the unstructured text.

The extraction of named entities allows more complex processing of unstructured text to dervie contect and meaning. 

In this exerise we saw the following results using the describe function: 

1. Bitcoin had the highest mean positive score.
2. Both coins, Bitcoin and Ethereum had very similar compound scores.
3. Ethereum had the highest positive score.
